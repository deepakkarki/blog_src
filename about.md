I'm a software developer hailing from India. I recently got my bachelors in Computer
Science from [PES University](http://www.pes.edu/), Bangalore. I love anything to do with hardware, systems, web and open source. This is where I pen down all my ideas and opinions for others to see.
This website is built using Jekyll and is available on GitHub and uses the [lanyon theme](https://github.com/poole/lanyon). During my college days, I worked extensively on the embedded systems, operating systems and the internet of things. I'm currently working for [Nutanix](http://www.nutanix.com/) where I deal with distributed systems and cluster computing.
