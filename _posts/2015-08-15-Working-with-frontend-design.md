The <a href="http://deepakkarki.github.io/blog/2015/08/08/The-Hackend-Project/">Hackend Project</a> - Week 2
</div>

This is my second hackend project - I dealt with developing responsive websites with HTML5 and CSS3. And no, there was no bootstrap.

Started off with understanding some HTML and CSS3 to make websites look great. Made a simple blog page and a landing page. Honestly found web dev a bit annoying at the start, but once it starts sinking in, you'll be amazed with what you can create.


(I should be attaching screenshots of what I did here....)
