Presenting project Zygote at ACCS ADCOM.
<!--more-->
Earlier this week I had made a trip to IIT Madras to take part in the 21st International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications - [ADCOM 2105](http://accsindia.org/category/adcom/). The conference saw participation from top industrialists and professors from India and abroad. The main topic of discussion was IoT and smart cities. My project [Zygote](https://github.com/kres/zygote) got selected at the conference, and the paper will be indexed in IEEE Xplore.  

My involvement with IoT was also noticed by members and friends at the W3C consortium! Here is a screenshot of the mail I received.

I had a look at their proposal, and it seems amazing. So I will be working with the W3C guys in my free time to help design and develop the W3C WoT platform :)
